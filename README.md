#### Summary
Overall, we are able to filter on our criteria, but it comes with it's drawback.
###### Drawback
Adding more data to this table, requires us to get it into a format of data.js to be able to read it into a table. 
Also adding more data and filtering on it might take more time to display results.
###### Recommendations
1. To be able to read data in flat files, that way we can easily source data and convert it to flat files.
2. Come up with a way to optimize filtering so that it will not take more time when you add another field for filtering.
